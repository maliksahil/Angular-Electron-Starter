# AngularElectronStarter

This is an Angular CLI based project that gives you a starter template for an electron app.
You can dev most of your UX in browser with live reload, and then use dependency injection to change behavior of services to support electron when running native.

All feedback is welcome, email me at contact@winsmarts.com or leave comments under issues.
Thanks!!
